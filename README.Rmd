## Description:

This package is based on predictions and log marginal likelihood for Gaussian process regression (GP regression) algorithm proposed by C. Rasmussen and C. William[1]. This package is intended to use the GP regression algoithm to make prediciton based on gaussian-distribuated mutilvariate data. User can pass in a sequence of different kernels and compare the prediction accuracy across different kernels. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of standardGP from [GitHub](https://github.com/jiayilei/gppcv) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jiayilei/gppcv")
```

Then, use 

```
library(standardGP)
``` 

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to perform cross valdiation with a sequence of kernels by using ```gpr_cv```:

```{r example}
library(standardGP)
library(matrixcalc)
# intent inputs
n = 100 # number of inputs
p = 10 # number of features
n_kernels = 3 # number of kernels

set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(n*p, 0, 0.3), n, p)
y <- matrix(rnorm(n), n, 1)

num_folds=3
fold_ids <- sample((1:n) %% num_folds + 1, n)
sigma2 = 10
# first kernel
k1  <- function(r){
    return (exp(-r/1.5))
}
# second kernel
k2 <- function(r){
    return (exp(-0.5 * (r/1000)^2))
}
k = c(k1, k2) # list of kernels

# function output
out <- gpr_cv(X, y, k, sigma2, num_folds, fold_ids)
out
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
