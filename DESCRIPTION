Description: standardGP is a package that fits standardized Gaussian Progress regression via log marginal likelihood. The model will be trained with 
              inputs of training data, covariance function, noise level, and the test input data. This package will output mean function, variance 
              and the log marginal likelihood. This package contains a function to compare performance of different choices of kernels with different hyperparameters.
